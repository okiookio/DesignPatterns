//Dependency Inversion Principle:
//1) High level modules should not depend on low-level modules
//2) Both high and low level modules should depend on abstractions.
//3) Abstractions SHOULD NOT depend on details, but details SHOULD depend on abstractions.

//SOLUTION! This protocol introduces a layer of abstraction
protocol RelationshipBrowser {
    func findAllChildren(of name: String) -> [Person]
}



//low-level module: Specifies how to store the information

    }
    
    
//SOLUTION! implement the protocol

//high-level module: Uses the low-level data

    //!PROBLEM! This is a violation of the Dependency Inversion Principle.
    //Why? Because we are not only passing in the low-level module, but we are accessing its internals (.relations should be marked private)
//    init(relationships: Relationships) {
//        let relations = relationships.relations
//        for r in relations where r.0.name == "Tara" && r.1 == .parent {
//            print("\(r.0.name) has a child called \(r.2.name)")
//        }
//    }
    
    //SOLUTION!
    init(relBrowser: RelationshipBrowser) {
        
        for child in relBrowser.findAllChildren(of: "Tara") {

let Tara = Person(name: "Tara")

let rels = Relationships()
rels.addParentAndChild(p: Tara, c: Ruby)
rels.addParentAndChild(p: Tara, c: Silas)

//let _ = Research(relationships: rels)

//Now the high-level module no longer depends on the low-level module, but the abstraction. This means you can pass in any module that conforms to RelationshipBrowser.
