/*
 Composite
 Treating individual (scalar) and aggregate (composition) objects uniformly.
 
 Motivation
 Composition lets us make compound objects.
 Composite design pattern is used to treat both single (scalar) and composite objects uniformly.
 
 Provides identical interface for individual objects and groups of objects.
 */


//This class is using the composite design pattern as it can be an object with a name and color, but it can also contain objects of it's own type (and those objects can contain their own objects and so on...)
