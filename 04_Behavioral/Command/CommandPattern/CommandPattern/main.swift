/*
 CommandPattern
 Encapsulates all of the details of an operation in an object.
 Define instruction for applying the command (call, perform, execute) either in itself or in the object that it is being applied to.
 Optionally you can define the steps for 'undoing' the command.
 Create composite commands (sequences of commands) known as macros
 
 Motivation:
 There is no tracking of your operations. You might change the value of something but have no record of what that change was or what the previous value was.
 Ordinary statements are perishable - eg: cannot undo a property assignment.
 Cannot directly serialize a sequence of actions (calls)
 We want an audit trail to roll back changes, so we want an object that represents an operation (suitable for GUI commands, multi-level undo/redo, macro recording and others....

//Another variation sees the command being passed to the account which then processes the command. This makes the command more reusable, you could pass the same command to a number of accounts (HOWEVER!) without one object holding reference to the other, you cannot undo the action.
