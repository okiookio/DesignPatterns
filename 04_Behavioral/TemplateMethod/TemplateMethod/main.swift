/*
 TEMPLATE METHOD
 Allows us to define the 'skeleton' of the algorithm with concrete implementation defined in the subclasses
 
 A high level blueprint for an algorithm to be completed by inheritors
 
 Algorithms can be decomposed into common parts and specifics. Strategy pattern does this through composition.
 High-level algorithm uses an interface
 concreate implementations implement the interface.
 
 Template method does the same thing but using inheritance. Algorithm makes use of abstract member
 Inheritors override the abstract members
 Parent template method invoked.
