/*
 A pattern in which the object's behavior is determined by its state. An object transitions from one state to another when it is triggered. A formalized construct that manages state and construction is called a State Machine.
 
 eg: the behavior of a phone depends on it's state on the hook/ off the hook/ engaged/
