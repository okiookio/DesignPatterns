/*
 Facilitates communication between components
 Components may go in and out of a system at any time and it makaes no sense to have them hold references to one another.
 The solution is to have all of these components hold reference to a central object that facilitates communication.
 Mediator has bi-directional communication with its components. Components call methods on the mediator (send) and mediator calls methods on the components (receive)

//Chat room: In this example the chat room holds reference to all of the people who can come and go as they wish. The methods that send messages in each person, in turn calls the broadcast or message method in the chat room.
