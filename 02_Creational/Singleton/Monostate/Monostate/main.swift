//MONOSTATE!
//instead of storing values in a single instance, store your values privately in the class and access them from any number of instances

//THE ISSUE...
//A Monostate works like a singleton, but it doesn't communicate that it is a singleton to the consumer. It looks like it should work like a class (because a Singleton has a 'shared' property and a monostate doesn't) CONFUSING TO THE USER!
//DON'T USE IT, BUT RECOGNIZE IT IF SOMEONE ELSE USES IT.
